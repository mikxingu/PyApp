# PyApps

This repository is a colletion of concepts that I made while reading  [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist ](https://www.amazon.com.br/Think-Python-Computer-Scientist-English-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9EQ/ref=asc_df_B018UXJ9EQ/?tag=googleshopp00-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=379765285844&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12550929525795029435&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1001765&hvtargid=pla-404032776186&psc=1).

I'll be updating this repo very frequently and I'll try to make comments on my apps as a good practice training.

Feel free to download, test and change the code you see here. 

I'd appreciate if you'd open an [Issue](https://github.com/mikxingu/PyApps/issues) to request some changes or give me some new ideas.
